# gh-sdp Phase 1 Stable Identifiers

Status: active project instruction
Scope: Phase 1 Mandate and operating records

The canonical SDP Toolkit at source commit
`bc110bb5fd60009ba67015cf640ad6ddbfe1b04b` defines no identifier grammar for a
Mandate or its outcomes, boundaries, assumptions, questions, or success
criteria. This project-owned instruction therefore establishes a local Phase 1
convention before those identifiers are used. It is not an upstream SDP format.

| Kind | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mandate | `MAN-###` | `MAN-001` |
| Mandate outcome | `MAN-OUT-###` | `MAN-OUT-001` |
| Mandate boundary | `MAN-BND-###` | `MAN-BND-001` |
| Mandate success criterion | `MAN-SC-###` | `MAN-SC-001` |
| Mandate assumption | `MAN-ASM-###` | `MAN-ASM-001` |
| Mandate question | `MAN-Q-###` | `MAN-Q-001` |
| Sprint | `Sprint-###` | `Sprint-001` |
| Sprint iteration | `SPI-###` | `SPI-001` |
| Sprint slice | `SPS-###` | `SPS-001` |
| Slice verification | `VER-<slice-id>` | `VER-SPS-001` |
| Slice review | `REV-<slice-id>-###` | `REV-SPS-001-001` |

Numbers are three decimal digits, are unique within their kind, and are never
reassigned to a different meaning. The authoritative definition remains in the
Mandate document. `SDP/Traceability/Relations.yaml` resolves the Mandate,
outcome, boundary, and success-criterion IDs to that document; other records
refer to the exact ID. Status is recorded separately and is not encoded in an
identifier.

The canonical release and Fix formats remain authoritative and are not redefined
here. A later authoritative Toolkit format for the project-local kinds above may
require a documented migration while preserving historical links.
